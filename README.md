## Week 6 was like it was on fast-forward:

- I didn't feel like I was grasping on to a lot of the concepts are were being taught.
- Also felt like I forgot a lot of what I learned.
- The assignment that we got after learning mapping and filtering discouraged me greatly.

needless to say, I'm **Not** confident in myself when it comes to this mid-term.
